# Why does this exist?
# - Neovim needs to be started different depending on where it's installed.
# - This used to be done by aliasing (n)vim to a function that picked the start command, but that breaks programs that use the $EDITOR envvar.
# - Instead, those aliases and the $EDITOR envvar now point to this tiny executable.
